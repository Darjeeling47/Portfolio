            "The PC application is a base game where players command their military, featuring two modes: Single Player and Two Player. At the start, a 25 x 25 map of terrains is randomly generated, including Land, Highland, Water, Bridge, and Town, each offering unique buffs and abilities. Players begin with various units: 1 Ship, 1 Destroyer Tank, 1 Heavy Tank, 2 Medium Tanks, 2 Light Tanks, 1 Sniper Soldier, 3 Heavy Soldiers, and 6 Normal Soldiers, each with distinct stats and skills such as activating a shield or grouping with another soldier. The objective is to defeat the opposing team, achieved either by eliminating all enemy units or invading the enemy's town. Each turn, players have 25 mana to perform actions, with the system providing assistance by identifying targets within range and finding the most efficient paths, making gameplay more intuitive. I organized the project, set up the structure of the application, and worked on all of the algorithms, ensuring a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.",
